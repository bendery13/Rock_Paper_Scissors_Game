### Inside the Game
&emsp; This Rock Paper Scissors game contains a text-based user interface (UI). Upon loading up the game, users are greeted with a welcome screen and asked which mode they would like to play. You can choose any of the following three options: 1) Single Player, 2) 2-Player, 3) Exit. To continue, enter the corresponding number for your decision.

&emsp; Selecting either option 1 or 2 will bring you to another welcome screen that will prompt you to enter how many games you would like to play the best of. It informs the players that any even numbers will be rounded up to require a simple majority of the games to be won to claim victory.

&emsp; After proceeding, the user can begin to play the game! If they are playing single-player mode, they decide by picking rock, paper, or scissors. As they pick, the computer makes its choice. Players can see what round they are playing and the score of the current game. When the user makes his or her choice, he or she is shown what decision the computer made, and a graphic is played depicting it. The two-player mode is similar to single-player, but after the first player makes a decision, the screen clears. This ensures that Player 2 will not see Player 1's move.

&emsp; When the game has finished, players are presented with the final score and shown who won the game.

&emsp; This screen will display for 5 seconds until it is redirected back to the main menu. Users are now back to where they started when they first opened the application. They can choose to play again or exit the app. Choosing to exit will close the game and leave your computer where it was before you opened Rock Paper Scissors. Now that you have learned some of the features of this game, download and enjoy this childhood classic!
